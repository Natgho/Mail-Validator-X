# mail_validator_X
A close friend needed an e-mail confirmer so I wrote a simple program for him. I'm really happy to share such an useful program for you. Let's check it out and share your ideas. (Thanks to Deniz Saglam)

## How to use?
1. First, install "pyisemail, py3dns, validate_email" modules...
2. put the mails you want to check in the file "mail.txt"
3. Which method to use if you call it with python3 ("python3 email_checker.py" or "python3 other_way.py")
4. When the process is finished you should see the message "validation complete".
5. When the message comes out, you can look at the results "results.txt" and "results2.txt".

Have a nice day :)
